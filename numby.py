Playground code for Python numbers

Number data types store numeric values.

Number objects are created when you assign a value to them

Assignment, add 5 things
  1. make int, float, complex
  2. show math on each
  3. show math functions (variety)
  4. show random
  5. ... you pick (perhaps something from your math class) ...

print("Hello Series: numby.py")  # identification message

num1 = 1  # int
num2 = 2.8  # float
num3 = 3 + 1j  # complex
print(num1)
print(num2)

# Arithmetic
# Addition
first = int(input("Enter a number: "))
second = int(input("Enter a 2nd number: "))
print("first + second = ", first + second)

# Subtraction (-)
# Repeat the last program, but this time make it subtract

# Multiplication (*)

# Division (/)

# Calculate remainder of Division (%)

# Square
# Try one input and square it

# Order of Operations use ()'s'
# Input the number (7), 7 * 3 + 4
# Input the number (7), do everything backwards, 4 + 3 * 7, did you get what you expect?
