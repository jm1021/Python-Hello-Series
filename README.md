# Hello Series
More than Hello, World! Make sure you run OPTION 5 to see text based animation. This project contains a variety of classroom and technical hellos. All these samples are built "to kickoff" student ideas and work.

# Purpose (AP CSP Hello World)
* Classroom start in foundation of Collaboration using Slack, Google Docs, Padlets, and Zoom.
* Individuals establish a relationship (digital) with your Pair/Trio team member(s), project team, and teacher.
* Foundation in Python coding using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login).
* Using and Understanding [AP CSP Course Requirements](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)
* Installing future foundational technical tools for class, namely: IntelliJ IDE. GitHub Version Control.  
* Establishing assesment and grading practices. Learning about Sprints and Deliberables. 

## Project (ASCII/Unicode Art Project)
Read and review each Python file.

Students need to understand that explorations are required, you are to set  goals as a project team, form a Project Plan, and get approval from teacher on goals.  Each Friday you will have a project deliverable.

Grading criteria is based on [AP Computer Science A Computational and Thinking Practices: Skills Page 16](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) (CaTP) and [21st century skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_skills).  Rubric should consider the following.
* Critical Thinking, Program, Design, Logic, Implementation - CaTP 1, 2, 3: design, documentation of goals prior to implementaton, coding, algorithms, and meeting technical goals. 25%
* Communication and Presentation, Testing - CaTP 4, 5: Evidence showing completenes according to design and goals.  Ability of Teacher to understand procedures,  ability of Teacher to understand instructions or videos, showing how to run and execute.  Code organization, comments, documentation are all part of communication. 25%
* Collaboration, CaTP 6:  Collabortive in the development of a solution, acknowledging contribution of others, appropriate behaviors and employing ethics (ie no copying). Performing peer evaluations as requested by Teacher. 25%
* Creativity and Intangibles: The intagibles are participation, active learning, being proactive, genuine effort, positve attitude, inside-outside-the-box efforts.  Creativity is running with an idea, being exited about that idea, and attempting a techncial design and solution (note: sometimes it is ok if that idea does not completely work) 25%
Note: Grading will be highly influenced by Scrum team and individuals assesment.


## Overview of provided Code
Here is overview of files for "Hello Series":
* Main.java: Menu for the project.  Start learning Python.
* mody folder: Module direcoty containg Question class and an adventure sample.
* wipy folder: Various works in progress to support classroom discussions.
* Stringy.java: A playground file, no real structure.  This is used to learn about and how to print or output to console ASCII/Unicode/Other characters.
* Numby.java: Another playground file.  This is required file for student exploration.  Links are provided as a guid.
* Listy: Third playground file.  This file requires update by student to output some family and computer information.
* Loopy (Loopy): Learn some fundamentals of procedural programming.  This file stores "Monkey Jumper" data, loops through data, and outputs it to screen.
* Classy.java (Classy): Introduction to some of the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).  This file stores "Monkey Jumper" data in an OOP paradigm.  This introduces students to a way of performing animation.

| Unit | Percentage | Hello Series usage |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | 10-13% | The comments of this project are full of exploration ideas, Zoom, Cavas and Slack will promote collaboration |
|  Big Idea 2: Data | 17-22% | Listy, Loopy, and Classy are programs that illustrate data use and abstraction. |
|  Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | 30-35% | Menus use conditionals and recursion.  Loopy and Classy uses iteration. The folder mody abstracts logic into Classes and use Inheritance. |
|  Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | 11-15% | Repl.it is a group of computer systems that provide our Python coding learning environment  |
|  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | 21-26% |  Distance Learning is made possible to us today via the impacts of computing. |
