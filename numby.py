# Arithmetic
# Addition
first = int(input("Enter a number: "))
second = int(input("Enter a 2nd number: "))
print("first + second = ", first + second)

# Subtraction (-)
# Repeat the last program, but this time make it subtract

# Multiplication (*)

# Division (/)

# Calculate remainder of Division (%)

# Square
# Try one input and square it

# Order of Operations use ()'s'
# Input the number (7), 7 * 3 + 4
# Input the number (7), do everything backwards, 4 + 3 * 7, did you get what you expect?
